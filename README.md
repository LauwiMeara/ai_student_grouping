# README

This Jupyter notebook is made by Laura Groenhuijzen for the final assignment of the course "Inleiding Python Programmeren" (Introduction to Programming in Python) in the Certified Professional Program AI Engineer at the Open University in the Netherlands.

**The notebook has four parts:**
* Imports
* Classes
* Program
* Unittests

**Please note:**

It may take a while to get a response from the IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding API.

There is a delay in printing a scatterplot, due to creating dynamically placed marker labels. If the scatterplot takes too long to print, there is a faster alternative for placing marker labels available in the code.

The input is given by students of the course. Their names are anonimised.
